## Introduction
The "Rocket Telemetry Logger using Raspberry Pi Pico" repository is a hardware project aimed at collecting, logging, and displaying telemetry data from model rockets. The project utilizes various sensors such as MPU6050 for motion tracking, BMP280 for altitude and temperature readings, and an OLED display to show real-time data during the rocket's flight.

## Features
- Integration with Raspberry Pi Pico for data processing.
- MPU6050 sensor for motion tracking.
- BMP280 sensor for altitude and temperature readings.
- OLED display for real-time data visualization.
- Buzzer for audible alerts or notifications.
- MicroPython scripting for Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Connect MPU6050, BMP280, OLED display, and any other required components.
3. Install MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
4. Upload the project code to your device.

## How to Use
1. Power up your Raspberry Pi Pico with the connected sensors.
2. Launch the telemetry logging script.
3. The OLED display will start showing real-time data.
4. Monitor the telemetry data during the rocket's flight.
5. Use the buzzer for any alerts or notifications.

```python
# Sample Python code snippet
from telemetry_logger import TelemetryLogger

logger = TelemetryLogger()
logger.start_logging()
```
